# SpotiLikes
An Alfred workflow: A silly little tool that will summon your cherished Spotify likes at ludicrous warp-button speed :)

## Note
This is stupidly simple. All it does is open your liked songs playlist in Spotify. Enjoy, lol.

## Setup
1. Download the latest [.alfredworkflow release](https://github.com/matchadolly/SpotiLikes/releases).
2. Double click the downloaded file. It should open directly in Alfred.
3. Configure the workflow by choosing your own keyword, if you'd like, then click Install.
4. You are ALL SET!!

## Usage
Type your chosen _keyword_, e.g. "_sl_", and select the action "Open Spotify likes". That's it.
